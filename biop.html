                <p>As Python becomes a widely used language,more and more people can't tolerate their emotion of taking an attemption to "play" with python.If you are new to python, reading this article first might help you get a better understanding of python rather than walk in a misty forest.</p>
                <h2>Why Choose Python?</h2>
                <p>When we are working on a project,we will prefer to focus more on main implement of program than stack on a small but seems vital details,such as customize data structure.If you are using C or C++,you will be droven crazy about it.But in Python you might not need to concern it too much because python is "equiped" with a strong community,and various build-in type(they will be mentioned in later passages in this series).Now let's see a small program that do with python.</p>

                <p>Well this program might slightly beyond your comprehention , but you must get across something by this program without managing python's syntax which exactly results from python codes' easy-read and programmer friendly.In constrast, C and C++ might be more difficult to be gotten through by new learner.</p>
                <h2>What Can Python Do?</h2>
                <p>Generally, Python does not communicate directly with machine but do with a intermedia structure named Python Virture Machine(PVM) which stays between python code and your machine.This running mode might sometimes make python scripts spend more time running than C and C++ which communicate directly with machine.But in this way can python be added something readly useful like list, tuple and dictionary. They can make it more convenience when doing certain works.

                </p>
                <p>They seem to be intendly designed for developers who devote in science calculating.As I have said aforementioned that python make developer focus more on main project ,these useful build-in types can save abundant of energy of scripting them again in C or C++ ,and in return, more efficiency is improve in a high level.Back to the main title , let's see some main stream usages of python.</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Science calculate
                    </li>
                    <p>It is widely used.Python has a powerful liburary name Scipy and another named Numpy.You can get them in their official website or python official website.Also you can install conveniently by pip.When it come to installation on different platform, it is beyond our discussion in this passage,you can find your answer on search engine.If you want to be a big-data analysior or a data scientist or other occupations which do with data calculation, python is a strongly recommended choice.Later I can give some example of the efficiency contrast with normal calculate. #There is an example that compare time costed between normal calculating and scientific calculation supporting by scipy .click here to fly</p>
                    <li>Machine Learning</li>
                    <p>It's a hot topic nowadays that even some old progrommer edge to make "Transform" to jump into this big flood.In my view, it's also a reason why I choose python.I have made this decision in my senior 2 yesr and begin to learn about computer vision ,a sub-topic of machine learning.But advanced mathematic and flexible mind is highly required.There is uncountable algorithm in machine learning in this area , they might make you want to cry when you remind of that night you have made a decision to do machine learning.But is is really a interesting and meanful choice worth considerring.</p>
                    <li>Network Crawler</li>
                    <p>Crawler is one of my favorite implements on python.Just as its literature meaning, crawler is 'crawling on web'.This kind of python script is like crawler in land,they crawl on web and get informations on website ,then crawl to another website...This is a useful way to get information.I have wrote one to get articles on a website.Then I convert it into an ebook format, putting it into my kindle ,laying on grass and enjoy sunshine on texts,drinking a cup of coffe and another cup and ...BUT, there is also risky. To get away from the attention of server and use user agent to intend as a humand(you are a script now),there are many thing to prepare.</p>
