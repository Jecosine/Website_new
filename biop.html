                <p>When we are working on a project,we will prefer to focus more on main implement of program than stack on a small but seems vital details,such as customize data structure.If you are using C or C++,you will be droven crazy about it.But in Python you might not need to concern it too much because python is "equiped" with a strong community,and various build-in type(they will be mentioned in later passages in this series).Now let's see a small program that do with python.</p>
